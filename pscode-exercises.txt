// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

ask for the number
divide the number by 2 with the modulo operator in 
         order to get the remainder
if the remainder is 0
   print on the screen "The number is even"
else
   print on the screen "The number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

declare variables min-nbr and max-nbr
set min-nbr value to 9999999
set max-nbr value to 0

declare variables 1st-nbr, 2nd-nbr, 3rd-nbr, 4th-nbr, 5th-nbr, total, average

ask for value of 1st-nbr
if 1st-nbr > max-nbr
   set value of max-nbr to 1st-nbr
if 1st-nbr < min-nbr
   set value of min-nbr to 1st-nbr

ask for value of 2nd-nbr
if 2nd-nbr > max-nbr
   set value of max-nbr to 2nd-nbr
if 2nd-nbr < min-nbr
   set value of min-nbr to 2nd-nbr

ask for value of 3rd-nbr
if 3rd-nbr > max-nbr
   set value of max-nbr to 3rd-nbr
if 3rd-nbr < min-nbr
   set value of min-nbr to 3rd-nbr

ask for value of 4th-nbr
if 4th-nbr > max-nbr
   set value of max-nbr to 4th-nbr
if 4th-nbr < min-nbr
   set value of min-nbr to 4th-nbr

ask for value of 5th-nbr
if 5th-nbr > max-nbr
   set value of max-nbr to 5th-nbr
if 5th-nbr < min-nbr
   set value of min-nbr to 5th-nbr

set value of total to 0
add 1st-nbr, 2nd-nbr, 3rd-nbr, 4th-nbr, and 5th-nbr to total
divide total by 5 and set the value of average to the result

print on screen "Minimum is " + min-nbr
print on screen "Maximum is " + max-nbr 
print on screen "Average is " + average
